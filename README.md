# Infuller
A small library documenting the existing items, weapons, tiles, etc. present in Terraria. The goal of this library is to make everything more "accurate".

### Example
An example of this would be the `IInfullerPrefix` which allows you to give an "alignment" to the prefix, meaning a Very Bad, Bad, Neutral, Good or Very Good prefix.
These alignments correspond to the prefix tiers on the [wiki page](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Modifiers#Complete_list).
